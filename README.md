# machine-learning-side-projects
This folder include my side projects that I did during the Coursera machine learning course.

1. Linear Regression: predict housing prices in Portland, Oregon using gradient descent algorithm with feature normalization.
2. Logistic Regression: implement regularized logistic regression to predict whether microchips from a fabrication plant passes quality assurance. Apply feature mapping to generate polynomial terms in order to obtain an accurate non-linear boundary.
3. Multi-class Classification and Neural Network: implement a one-vs-all logistic regression model and the feedforward propagation part of a nerual network to recognize hand-written digits.
4. Neural Networks Learning: implement the backpropagation algorithm for neural networks and apply it to the task of hand-written digit recognition.
5. Regularized Linear Regression and Bias v.s. Variance: implement regularized linear regression and generate the learning curves to study models with different bias-variance properties.
6. Support Vector Machines: use support vector machines (SVMs) to build a email spam classifier.
7. K-means Clustering and Principal Component Analysis: (a) implement the K-means clustering algorithm and apply it to compress an image. (b) implement principal component analysis to find a low-dimensional representation of face images.
8. Anomaly Detection and Recommender Systems: (a) implement the anomaly detection algorithm and apply it to detect failing servers on a network. (b) implement collaborative filtering to build a recommender system for movies.
