# machine-learning-side-projects
This folder include my side projects that I did during the Coursera machine learning course.

1. Linear Regression.
2. Logistic Regression.
3. Multi-class Classification and Neural Network: implemented one-vs-all logistic regression and neural networks to recognize hand-written digits.
4. Neural Networks Learning: implemented the backpropagation algorithm for neural networks and apply it to the task of hand-written digit recognition.
5. Regularized Linear Regression: implemented regularized linear regression and use it to study models with different bias-variance properties.
6. Support Vector Machines: used support vector machines (SVMs) to build a spam classifier.
7. K-means Clustering and Principal Component Analysis: (a) applied K-means clustering algorithm to compress an image; (b) used principal
component analysis to find a low-dimensional representation of face images.
8. Anomaly Detection and Recommender Systems: (a) applied anomaly detection algorithm to detect failing servers on a network; (b) use collaborative filtering to build a recommender system for movies.
